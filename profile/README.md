## What we are doing?
What PWS has built is a wealth system that integrates and optimizes 3 historically siloed generational planning disciplines - estate, investment, and insurance planning. By creating a singular objective function, PWSâ€™ system transforms the risk conversation from simply tracking portfolio volatility (accumulation focus) to optimizing distributions regardless of portfolio performance (distribution focus). When measured and tested over 99-year simulations, real estate investors, family offices/operating businesses, and securities investors experience outcomes in multiples of 3x and greater.
