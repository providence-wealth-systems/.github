# Contributing To PWS

## Good quality Pull Requests (PRs)

### Peer/Code Review:
- Encourage a culture of peer review by making it a standard practice for all code changes.
- Assign dedicated reviewers who are knowledgeable in the relevant areas of the codebase.
- Clearly define the objectives and scope of the review, including purpose, functionality, performance, security/risk mitigation, and maintainability.
- Provide constructive feedback, focusing on improving code quality, adherence to coding standards, and potential bugs or vulnerabilities.
- Establish a review process that ensures timely and thorough feedback.
- Individual growth of ICs is a major value of PWS, so if you see something of concern, notice something worthy of praise, or have any questions about the code you are reviewing, please comment.
### Well-documented commits:
- Emphasize the importance of clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose of the change.
- A large amount of small, well summarized commits is better than a few large commits with many pieces of functionality
- Encourage developers to provide contextual information in their commits, such as why the change was made, any considerations or trade-offs, and related issue or ticket numbers.
- Recommend referencing relevant documentation, design decisions, or discussions in commit messages for future reference.
### Well-commented code:
- Promote the practice of writing self-explanatory code by using meaningful variable and function names.
- Encourage comments to explain complex algorithms, non-obvious logic, or assumptions.
- Highlight any potential areas of improvement, known issues, or areas requiring attention in the comments.
- Advise against excessive commenting on obvious or trivial code, as it may clutter the codebase.
### Code coverage requirements:
- Set specific code coverage targets appropriate for your project and industry standards.
- Use code coverage analysis tools to measure the percentage of code covered by automated tests.
- Encourage developers to write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for critical functionality and corner cases.
- Regularly monitor and report code coverage to ensure continuous improvement in test coverage.
- Regarding the code of conduct readme file blurb, you can include a statement like the following:
